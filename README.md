The purpose of this repository is to practice and save [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) files that are related to machine learning with Tensorflow. Currently, I am following a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/104sRw3@D4fIWuFk4kfelFPyPMINZmgld0UP4HVnutCd3x8Prd0WQgOhAyBn1yjjPbdZiHwNcw==/) and mainly, I update this repository with course related works.
